1. Edit button
    - Will trigger a pop up window or separate page (toggle)
    - Only this pop up window or separate page, I can edit the title and text (edit form)
        - Prefilled with current data
        - 
    - Once I write what I want, then I can click submit and pop up will close
        - Fetches new data

My questions
 - How do I make the popn up window appear?
 - How do I have PUT on the same page or does it need to separate? I don't understand the basics
 - Prop is confusing me and my old assignmets ony haven it . So what is the old and traditional way of pressing the edit button and it making changes on the current state of the form?
 - How can I just focus on one entry at a time and not the whole list?

  1. I am able to map over the form and display the current data
  2. At the moment it is controlled input fields, so how do I edit them?
  3. After I figure out how to edit them, how do I make sure that I am just
  viewing the specfic ID? Like after clicking edit , i want to be directed to that id I clicked on

  - Is my onchange right?
  - Is the onsubmit working?

  What I know so far:
  Postman server - put works!
  I am able to map over and view the current data on the controlled input fields
