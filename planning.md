July 29

1. Edit button
    - Will trigger a pop up window or separate page (toggle)
    - Only this pop up window or separate page, I can edit the title and text (edit form)
        - Prefilled with current data
        - 
    - Once I write what I want, then I can click submit and pop up will close
        - Fetches new data

My questions
 - How do I make the popn up window appear?
 - How do I have PUT on the same page or does it need to separate? I don't understand the basics
 - Prop is confusing me and my old assignmets ony haven it . So what is the old and traditional way of pressing the edit button and it making changes on the current state of the form?
 - How can I just focus on one entry at a time and not the whole list?
